# M-Random Password Generator

This is my version of a random password generator created using Python.
I used the **secrets, string** and **pyperclip** modules in this program.
The **pyperclip** module allows one to paste the random password anywhere they would like for example on a notepad.
The password generated contains uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
